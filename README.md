# Awesome Hyper Casual :partying_face:
This repository contains a curated list of resources, links, assets, projects and more about hyper casual game development. Free assets and resources are prioritized over paid when possible.

## Contribution
First of all, any kind of contribution is highly appreciated. If you want to add any kind of _thing_ here -from the stickman asset you made yesterday to the article about user acquisition you saw this morning- here's the steps: fork the repo, work in your branch, open a PR and I'll merge it as soon as possible. For the ones who are non-developer, you can send email to [me](mailto:sinann.ermis@gmail.com?subject=My%20Contribution%20to%20Awesome%20HC) and I'll add them by crediting you.
